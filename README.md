# WarRobots-TicTacToe
A minigame bot for War Robots, simulating a TicTacToe game, with a twist, the game keeps increasing its size the longer it goes!

[WIP] TicTacToe 5x5 grid

I searched the online Minigame bots section to get a TicTacToe, but coudlnt find one which suited my needs. I enjoy making my own games hence, i created this which is still a work in progress.

The motive of the game is to start with a Classic tic tac toe game with 3x3 grid however the catch is that the more turns are played, the higher the chance gets to increase the board size.
the board size will increase upto 5x5 grid and players will be faced with unforseen events like a "meteor strike" which will destroy any "X" or "O" in a 2x2 square area.

There are many other events which are yet to be added. 

Players will also have an option to buy abilites, there will be 2 types of abilites, "AGGRESIVE" and "DEFENSIVE"
